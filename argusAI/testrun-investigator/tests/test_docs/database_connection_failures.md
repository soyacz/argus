# Description
This document provides instructions for investigating test failures related to database connection issues. It covers scenarios where tests fail due to timeouts, connection pooling problems, or database server unavailability.

# Instructions
When investigating database connection test failures:

1. Check the database server status and connectivity
2. Verify connection string configuration in test environment
3. Examine connection pool settings and limits
4. Review database logs for error messages or timeouts
5. Test database connectivity from the test runner environment
6. Check for network issues between test runner and database server
7. Verify database user permissions and authentication
8. Consider increasing connection timeout values if appropriate
9. Look for concurrent connection limits being exceeded
10. Examine transaction isolation levels that might cause blocking
