# Description
This document contains instructions for analyzing test failures that occur due to API endpoint issues, including HTTP errors, timeout problems, rate limiting, and authentication failures in API-based tests.

# Instructions
For API endpoint test failures, follow these investigation steps:

1. Verify the API endpoint URL and HTTP method being used
2. Check HTTP status codes returned by the API calls
3. Examine request and response headers for authentication tokens
4. Look for rate limiting headers (X-RateLimit-* headers)
5. Verify request payload format and content-type headers
6. Check API server logs for internal errors or exceptions
7. Test the API endpoint manually using curl or Postman
8. Verify network connectivity to the API server
9. Check for SSL/TLS certificate issues
10. Review API documentation for recent changes or deprecations
11. Examine timeout configurations in the test client
12. Look for API versioning issues in the request headers
