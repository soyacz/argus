"""
Example usage of the VictoriaLogs integration module.

This script demonstrates how to use the victoria_logs module to:
1. Ingest logs from a test run archive using stream-based organization
2. Check ingestion status
3. Query action logs with stream filters and time filtering
4. Query specific events from raw events log using stream filters
5. Use the new query_logs_by_stream method for flexible querying

Note: This is a demonstration script. In a real scenario, you would
provide actual URLs and valid run/event IDs.

Stream Organization:
- Actions logs are stored in the 'action' stream
- Raw events logs are stored in the 'events' stream
- Stream filters provide optimized query performance
